Student Fees Generator
The program is used to identify every student in the university and generate
the desasiswa fees and the student fees including the tuition fees and facility fees .
The student fees and desasiswa fees repayment system is solved using an
object-oriented approach. The fees of the students can be solved through the
program. Every student we then let each object execute its own method to solve this
problem. We make every student the object of the student class. We use object
oriented to solve the payment system of the student fees and desasiswa fees
because every student has the same common characteristic which is student living
desa, student subject taken and using the same facility. The difference between each
object is they have different desasiswa fees according to the desa they are living in
.For the student subject taken, they have different tuition fees according to the
different subject taken. Code reusability is high when it is designed using an
object-oriented approach. For example, we solve the problem and provide the object
various attributes and methods. As a result, this programme is designed to allow
users to calculate their fees throughout their studies in the university
